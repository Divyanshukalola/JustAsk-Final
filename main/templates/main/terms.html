<p>Functionality on the Services may also permit interactions between the Services and a third-party web site or online feature, including applications that connect the Services or your profile on the Services with a third-party site. For example, the Services may include a button enabling you to indicate, on your social networking page, that you "like" a specific product on the Services, or a feature that lets you post to your social networking page a link to a specific product or the ability to share content from the Services or your User Content with a third-party, which may be publicly posted on that third-party's web site. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to your account on the third-party website. We do not control any of these third-party sites or any of their content. Neither Just Ask nor its service providers are responsible for the practices of any third-party. Accordingly, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we make no representations or warranties about the completeness, accuracy, or existence of any advertising, products, or other materials on or available from third-party sites or online features and any reliance placed by you on such materials is at your own risk.

<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">Course Searches and Other Information Specific to an Academic Institution</p>
<p>We may tie your Just Ask experience to information about the school you have identified to Just Ask. For certain schools, the Services enable you to search and retrieve information about the materials required for particular courses. Please be aware that course information and assigned materials may change from time to time, and Just Ask may not receive updated information from the school in a timely manner. Just Ask is not responsible for any errors in the information provided in the course searches on the Services. Where specific school names or information relate to a specific school are displayed, they do not imply any endorsement or approval by the school. Except where specifically stated, Just Ask has no affiliation with nor endorsement from any academic institution, and school names and information are used on the Services only to the extent necessary to organize, identify and permit use of information and sections of the Services that may be tailored to students of a particular school, or for other lawful uses.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">Homework Help, Study Guide and Note Usage</p>
<p>Just Ask's homework help, study and note services are available merely as informational and study aids and should not be considered substitutes for applicable coursework, homework, class and lecture requirements, assignments and related materials. In using the Services, you specifically agree not to use, claim or submit as your own any portion of the help materials. Just Ask does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of answers or other study material that appear on the Services, some of which may be posted by other users. You further agree the Services may present information that is incorrect or inconsistent when compared to similar content and materials, including solutions and their methodologies, provided or preferred by publishers of applicable problems or instructors of applicable courses.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">Reporting Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Violations</p>
<p>Just Ask respects the intellectual property rights of others and takes the protection of copyrights and other intellectual property seriously. Only the intellectual property rights owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner can report potentially infringing content. If you believe your work has been infringed through the Services, please notify us at Just Ask at <a href="mailto:support@just-ask.in">support@Just Ask.com.</a></p>
<ol>
  <li>Your contact information, including name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address.</li>
  <li>A description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed (including, e.g., the title, ISBN and other bibliographic information for books).</li>
  <li>A reasonably specific description of where the allegedly infringing material is located on the Services (including, e.g., the URL);</li>
  <li>A statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the allegedly infringing material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
  <li>Your electronic or physical signature.</li>
  <li>A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf; and</li>
  <li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>NOTE: </b>This contact information is for inquiries regarding potential copyright and other infringement only.
We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter.
</p>
<p>Just Ask will provide you with notice if your materials have been removed based on a third-party complaint of alleged infringement of the third-party's intellectual property rights. You agree we may provide your notice to the provider of the allegedly infringing material. We have a policy of terminating accounts of users who repeatedly and intentionally infringe the intellectual property rights of others.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">Legal Disputes</p>
<p>If a dispute arises between you and Just Ask, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Accordingly, you agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that relates to or arises out of the Terms of Use or the Services or your use of the Services (a "<b>Claim</b>") in accordance with the subsections below.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">Policies</p>
<p>When using the Services, you are subject to any posted policies or rules applicable to features you use through the Services, including without limitation the General Policies and all policies referenced in the General Policies or elsewhere in this Agreement. All such policies or rules are hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use. These policies may change from time to time.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">Free Trial Memberships</p>
<p>We may from time to time offer free trials for some of our Services. Such trials may require you to register with a valid credit card to commence. Users that sign up for a free trial membership at a particular level will be automatically renewed at the promoted membership rate for that level at the end of the trial period unless the user cancels the membership at least before the end of the trial, unless the terms of the offer explicitly state otherwise. You can cancel a free trial online on the Services or by contacting Just Ask's customer support. After cancellation of a free trial, you may be able to continue as a Free Member with reduced benefits or access. Only one free trial membership is allowed per person. Subsequent registrations do not qualify for free trials. Unless the terms of a promotion state otherwise, for promotions that include "free" periods with "paid" periods, paid periods will elapse first. We may introduce new or additional features, services or materials to the Services which may be a part of, or priced separately from, existing levels of membership at our sole discretion.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">E-Notes and Study Guides</p>
<p>Just Ask’s homework help, study and e-note services are available merely as informational and study aids and should not be considered substitutes for applicable coursework, homework, class and lecture requirements, assignments and related materials. In using the Services, you specifically agree not to use, claim or submit as your own any portion of the help materials. Just Ask does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of answers or other study material that appear on the Services, some of which may be posted by other users. You further agree the Services may present information that is incorrect or inconsistent when compared to similar content and materials, including solutions and their methodologies, provided or preferred by publishers of applicable problems or instructors of applicable courses.
</p>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">Just Ask Honor Code</p>
<p>We know that most of you have never and will never abuse the Services or any of the information, services or materials available through them. You agree to abide by our Honor Code.</p>
<p>You may not use any of the solutions, answers, materials or information available on or through the Services, to cheat. Examples include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Submitting any textbook solutions from the Services as your own to any class.</li>
  <li>Using our questions and answers service to complete tests or homework when instructed not to use outside help.</li>
  <li>Otherwise passing along any solutions, answers, materials or information from the Services as your own.</li>
  <li>Any other violation of your instructor's or school's academic honor code.
We will take swift action against anyone found violating this Honor Code. If Just Ask is presented with evidence that its Services have been used in a manner contrary to its Honor Code or any other part of these Terms of Use, Just Ask may, in its sole discretion, remove the materials and terminate the account of the involved users.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; text-transform: uppercase;">E-Notes and Study Guides</p>
<p>Just Ask may permit users to upload for the purpose of aiding others in the education and learning process. Users may not post content owned or created (except if it is in the public domain) by another person and hereby represent and warrant that: (i) each was created by the user and the user is the sole owner of all content posted to Services sites and all rights in such content (except for public domain content), including, without limitation, copyright and  (ii) the posting of Content on or through the Services will not breach the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any third-party. Users agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing to any third-party for any content provided by you to the Services. Users of the Services agree to exclude from such content any documents, records or files made accessible to them by (a) your school, professor or other instructor, (b) any board of examination, (c) any author or publisher whose works have been used as part of studies or (d) any co-student.
</p>
<p>In creating study related content, students must respect any intellectual property rights that others may have in content. All content posted on the Services must be independently created, transformative and non-derivative. It should not be a transcript or recording of another's independent efforts, nor should it copy from materials purchased from or created by others. It should go beyond simply summarizing material covered in class or in written or recorded materials, but include information raised by students in or outside of class, and independent thought, analysis and commentary. E-notes, for example, must be substantially rewritten after class and include independent thought and analysis, research and information; e-notes that use a lecturer's words or that are not carefully reviewed, rethought and rewritten after class are not useful to or appreciated by students, and not permitted on the Services.
</p>
<p>Schools may have their own policies that place restrictions on a student's ability to make commercial use of study materials, even otherwise lawful materials that the student has independently created. You are responsible for becoming familiar with such policies, abiding by them, and discontinuing the use of any Services if such use is contrary to your school policy or the instruction of your professor.
E-Notes and study guides are solely for the specific use of students in the designated class for which they are created. Check the accuracy of all information from study guides, e-notes and answers – to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, Just Ask does not guarantee their accuracy or completeness, they are simply an aid to the study process.
